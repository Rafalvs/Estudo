You now own some property and you want to calculate the total area of the property.

Create a program that:

    Reads the width and height
    Prints the area

    Example: width = 5, height = 2
    Output: total_area = 10
*/

let width  = 5;
let height = 2;

let total_area = width * height;

console.log(total_area);
